### // OVERVIEW
This project is the final submission for the **Algorithm and Data Structures Laboratory**. It serves as a practical implementation of fundamental concepts, featuring a **Playlist Management System**. 

The system allows users to manage a curated list of tracks, simulating the core logic of a digital music library through efficient data manipulation and structural organization in a terminal-based environment.

### // TECH STACK
* **Language** | C++ (Standard 17)
* **Paradigm** | Procedural Programming
* **Logic focus** | Data Organization, Searching/Sorting Algorithms, and Memory Management.

### // CORE SYSTEM FEATURES
* **Dynamic Playlist Archive** | Managing a collection of digital "tracks" with unique metadata.
* **Structural Operations** | Implementation of core algorithms for adding, deleting, and traversing data units.
* **Terminal-based Interface** | A streamlined CLI designed for efficient user interaction and system feedback.
